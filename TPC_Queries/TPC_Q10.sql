-- Q10 - Returned Item Reporting Query - (SQL lines: Timbr-12, Without-17, SQL JOINS: Timbr-0, Without-3)
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
--In this query we use calculated properties such as volume, order_date_year, and order_date_quarter, and several relationships such as: has_ordered[order], has_line_item[returned_line_item], in_nation[nation], instead of using JOINS. Also, we created a child concept of the line_item concept called returned_line_item, and it contains only data where `return_flag` = â€˜Râ€™.
