-- Q9 - Product Type Profit Measure Query - (SQL lines: Timbr-7, Without-16, SQL JOINS: Timbr-0, Without-5)
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
--In this query we use a calculated property, several relationships between the supplier concept and the other concepts, and a classification of concepts in the ontology. In this example, we created a child concept of the product concept called green_product, and it contains only data where product_name like %green%. Also, we use a relationshipâ€™s property named from_supplier[green_product]_ps_supplycost, originating from the table tpc.partsupp.
